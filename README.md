This repository is my private recipe collection from various sources, mainly
from friends, webpages and family recipes. Most of the recipes are recorded
here because they are not in recipe books that I have at home. The others are
on the page to share them with friends.

The recipes are recorded in a custom markdown format, processor and translators
can be found in the recipe-markdown repository.
